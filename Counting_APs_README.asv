CLPS 950 Counting Action Potentials project with Stella and Camille

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

%ectopic action potential signal determination project
%I was trying to edit another person's repository by accident
%we used an abfload code (cloned the github repository) to load abf format
%files into matlab
%this returned a 3 dimentional table of values, which we then needed to
%plot
% to print data table, we used 
 d=abfload('22d11014.abf', 'start', 0, 'stop','e')
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

%to plot the data, we used 
close all
lowerl = 20000
upperl = 25000
plot(lowerl:uppe, d(:60000,3,20))
xlabel('Time(ms)')
ylabel('Membrane Potential (mV)')
%this allows us to zoom in (upper and lower limit refer to time in x axis) and look at individual action potentials to determine if they are successful

% 03/15/2023 update
% we have found a fi
=======
% to plot table, we used
close all
lowerl = 20000
upperl = 25000
plot(lowerl:upperl, d(lowerl:uperl,3,1))
xlabel('Time(ms)')
ylabel('Membrane Potential (mV)')

% the upper and lower limits refer to ms (time) on the x axis and they need to match

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

%ectopic action potential signal determination project
%I was trying to edit another person's repository by accident
%we used an abfload code (cloned the github repository) to load abf format
%files into matlab
%this returned a 3 dimentional table of values, which we then needed to
%plot
% to print data table, we used 
 d=abfload('22d11014.abf', 'start', 0, 'stop','e')

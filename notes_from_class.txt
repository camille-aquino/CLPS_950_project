Youtube tutorials about curve fitting data
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wDspsmzkyR8xUgXkAGMH677boRSYi4n 

Importing clampfit data (later versions) to matlab
it works correctly for my episodic simulation files:
https://github.com/fcollman/abfload/pull/5/commits/9fb0406fc02897161eedeffdd04d27f598534ecd

"You need to insert the following 2 line between lines 290-291:
tmpIx3=strfind((char(BigString)'),'IN');
h.comment1=char(BigString(tmpIx2(1)+4:tmpIx3(1)-1))';"

We see the input: 30,000 rows
Can input file from patch clamp, a program.
We thought we could have imaging software so something could recognize 
the curve of the action potential

Ivan’s Advice
"Best to have direct access to points, not the image
Can make it into a graph to detect slopes
Maybe not do it as an image
If you have access to points can detect curvature or maybe very narrow peaks 
As soon as you have data to play with let me know
First thing you should do is take it and plot it
Plot the action potentials
Next thing we work on the recognition, how to process each one of them”

Things to figure out

- Packages we can use 
‘Zooming in’ when the spikes are all so close together and small?
How many action potentials and what percent that is
Ectopics, and count how many action potentials were needed before the first ectopic

Ideas for Modeling

We got the data into matlab, just need to figure out what to do with it

Example: 22d14044.abf

size(d) -- tells us there are three dimensions

Ivan's advice: compare per dimension to see where the important points lay

X and y 
X and z 
Y and z

plotting every dimension to see where the points are

Figured out third dimension (third channel) is where the membrane potential points are


plot(1:200000, d(:,3,1))
plot(1:200000, d(:,3,2))
plot(1:200000, d(:,3,3))

**  third number is how many sweeps there are 
sweeps = ? (some science thing)

first find size: 

size(d)

put size in place of 1:size, then put sweep in third number
ex: 
size(d) = 60000 4 20

number of sweeps = 20

plot(1:60000, d(:,3,20))


-----
200000 per sweep

Each sweep how many seconds long?

10 sec long protocols

Measurements of Vm were 2000 Hz, meaning every second of the sweep we measured Vm 2000 times
3 secs long = 60000 
10 secs long = 200000

Worked on our respective parts for an 1 hr
Stella made the graph pretty 
I figured out that curvefitter may not be what we need, played around with the app with growing despair

Meeting with Ivan:

- Recommending we look at each sweep in smaller increments first 
    - Maybe make a function we can just call to run it 
    - Have lower limit  (2000s) and upper limit 

Looking at these windows we have positive example but try to find negative example (slope?):
- Once you have derivative, you can plug the derivative and even just the sign 
    (like + + + , 0, - - - ) can keep track of change in sign, 
    whenever it happens in a window, it really depends so much 
    on when you start, just make sure every time the next two or three is from a different sign
    You can find 0 and that means it's a spike, then check next window and see if there’s another peak
    to confirm if it's an action potential

- Stella says certain protocols (30Hz vs 100Hz) are near 100% (all are APs) while others have a lot
    more fails

Stella made derivative plot. She explained to me the science of determining 
an action potential based on if the derivative dy = 0. There will be 4 times
dy = 0, so we can either have another equation y = 0 and count the number of 
intersections, or make a loop that counts the number of times dy = 0.

Meeting with Ivan (office hours) -- 45 minutes (.75 hrs)

Notes: counting derivative
% other method:
% closet = d(d>0 & d < th)
% success = length(closet) > th2

% need case a without ectopic
% case b with ectopic -- take derivative, then long number of 0s before
% hits a spike (just create case for each one)
% make histogram -- time, count of spikes, at some point you'll have 0s for
% certain number and then the ectopic -- can say there's long number of 0s
% before 
% can make case for each of those 


% width is different for different protocols/frequencies (30 Hz, 60 Hz,
% etc.)

Youtube tutorials about curve fitting data
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wDspsmzkyR8xUgXkAGMH677boRSYi4n 

Importing clampfit data (later versions) to matlab
it works correctly for my episodic simulation files:
https://github.com/fcollman/abfload/pull/5/commits/9fb0406fc02897161eedeffdd04d27f598534ecd

"You need to insert the following 2 line between lines 290-291:
tmpIx3=strfind((char(BigString)'),'IN');
h.comment1=char(BigString(tmpIx2(1)+4:tmpIx3(1)-1))';"

We see the input: 30,000 rows
Can input file from patch clamp, a program.
We thought we could have imaging software so something could recognize 
the curve of the action potential

Ivan’s Advice
"Best to have direct access to points, not the image
Can make it into a graph to detect slopes
Maybe not do it as an image
If you have access to points can detect curvature or maybe very narrow peaks 
As soon as you have data to play with let me know
First thing you should do is take it and plot it
Plot the action potentials
Next thing we work on the recognition, how to process each one of them”

Things to figure out

- Packages we can use 
‘Zooming in’ when the spikes are all so close together and small?
How many action potentials and what percent that is
Ectopics, and count how many action potentials were needed before the first ectopic

Ideas for Modeling

We got the data into matlab, just need to figure out what to do with it

Example: 22d14044.abf

size(d) -- tells us there are three dimensions

Ivan's advice: compare per dimension to see where the important points lay

X and y 
X and z 
Y and z

plotting every dimension to see where the points are

Figured out third dimension is where the membrane potential points are


plot(1:200000, d(:,3,1))
plot(1:200000, d(:,3,2))
plot(1:200000, d(:,3,3))

**  third number is how many sweeps there are 
sweeps = ? (some science thing)

first find size: 

size(d)

put size in place of 1:size, then put sweep in third number
ex: 
size(d) = 60000 4 20

number of sweeps = 20

plot(1:60000, d(:,3,20))




-----
200000 per sweep

Each sweep how many seconds long?

10 sec long protocols

Measurements of Vm were 2000 Hz, meaning every second of the sweep we measured Vm 2000 times
3 secs long = 60000 
10 secs long = 200000

Worked on our respective parts for an 1 hr
Stella made the graph pretty 
I figured out that curvefitter may not be what we need, played around with the app with growing despair
